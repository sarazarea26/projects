# Education Dropout Rates Notebook

This notebook explores predictors of high school dropout rates using a small educational dataset. The goal was to understand which factors were most associated with students becoming at risk of dropping out.

Key methods:
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis
- Training and evaluating a Decision Tree classifier
- Generating visualizations to interpret patterns and model behavior

Dependencies:
- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Output:
- The model identified several features that contributed to dropout risk, and the exploratory analysis helped illustrate how different variables relate to student outcomes.
